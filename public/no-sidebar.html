								<p>I am very passionate about my hobbies. Many people including my wife would label me as a hoarder, but I prefer the term "Collector". I love collecting Baseball Cards, Coins, Historical Firearms, Boy Scout Patches, and antiques in general. I have a saltwater reef tank where I keep my fish and grow corals from around the world. I love to golf, I am terrible at golfing but enjoy going as often as possible. I enjoy leatherworking, mostly just making belts and small containers and little odds and ends. I also like to go shooting at the range although I struggle to actually hit the targets. I am most passionate about hobbies that require me to learn. I feel like I have wasted my day if there was any hour during the day that I didn't learn something new. Which is why I feel like I have found my calling in life as a developer, working in a world that has no limits to what you can learn in a lifetime of practice.</p>
