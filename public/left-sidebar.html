								<p>I am fairly new to the industry, having worked the last several years in Insurance and in Customer Service. I took several beginning level web development classes my freshman year of college in 2010. Before that I took a couple middle school and high school web design classes a million years ago when we were just using Microsoft Notepad to do our coding. I hadn't really looked at pursing a career in development until recently. My brother is a Software Engineer and sort of talked me into looking into the industry. I attended DevMountain at the Provo, Utah campus and left my wife and two young sons for 3 months to learn to code. Having committed to this career change so that I could better support my family, I spent 12-14 hour days for 13 consecutive weeks doing nothing but learning code. I learned a significant amount of Javascript utilizing the React framework and further honed my HTML and CSS skills that I had started learning more than a decade earlier. Throughout my 3 month DevMountain experience, I was able to help create a group project and a personal project. I have included those projects here in my portfolio. For my personal project, lookingtotomorrow.com I was awarded "Best Overall" and "Most Shippable" among all the projects in my cohort. Since Badging from DevMountain I have been working as the sole web developer for Recovered Energy in Pocatello, Idaho building joining Shopify and redesigning an existing Wordpress site to help the company increase revenue and push their business into the modern web. I love to learn and I look forward to continuing my journey of learning throughout my life and throughout my career in the development community.</p>
