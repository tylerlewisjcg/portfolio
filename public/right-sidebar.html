								<p>I was born in San Jose, California but moved to Pocatello, Idaho when I was young. I grew up in Idaho, graduating from Highland High School in 2007. I spent a year living on my own and with friends learning that being a successful adult is a lot more work than my parents made it look. I served a two year LDS mission in Everett Washington where I learned the responsibilities of leadership and team-building to work together with my peers to achieve common goals. I returned from my mission in 2010 and attended Idaho State University, where I met the girl of my dreams, Chante`. Chante` and I were married 1 year later and we now have two young sons, Wyatt and Emmett. I worked in a few different random jobs early in our marriage while she finished school as a Medical Assistant. I had the opportunity to own my own small business buying and selling used things online and through auctions. Lewis Trading Company was a rousing success the first year, but the second year I realized I needed a career change. I worked with Allstate Insurance company for over 2 years as a Customer Service Representative, New-Hire Mentor, and Coaching Partner. I was able to gain experience handling customers requests and de-escalating issues. I also gained experience training newly hired employees to use best practices and learn the insurance industry. It was here at Allstate where I feel that I came to truly appreciate the importance of culture and communication in the workplace, and the importance of being able to adapt to changing scenarios and requirements. I continue to be passionate about learning and enjoy adapting to new environments. I am a believer in adaptability in the workplace and strive to be an advocate for positive change and innovation.</p>
